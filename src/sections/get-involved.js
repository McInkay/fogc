                Anyone is welcome to attend our meetings, which are held quarterly. We particularly would like to see past or present parents, who can add experience and invaluable advice, especially on specialist toys and equipment. We would also like to invite local residents who have some spare time and an interest in the centre and would like to meet new people.

                We do not currently have a membership fee. As a member you will receive an invitation to our AGM and you are welcome to join us at our quarterly meetings throughout the year. These are generally evening meetings, held at the cottage. As well as dealing with the business side of things these meetings have evolved to provide an informal ‘parent support group’ where parents can have a chat and share ideas and experiences. Occassionally, we also invite speakers to come to speak to the group.

                If you would like to join, please email us with your name, address, email address and telephone number. Please also advise for our records what your interest in 'Friends of Gordon Cottage' is. ie Parent/Professional/Local Resident etc.
